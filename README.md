# ThreeNPlusOne.java
* This program prints out a 3N+1 sequence starting from a positive
* integer specified by the user. It also counts the number of
* terms in the sequence, and prints out that number.

* This solution is my implementation, achieved through trial and error and a lot of reading.
* I am happy to say that I am starting to code like a software engineer.

# ThreeN1.java
* This program prints out a 3N+1 sequence starting from a positive
* integer specified by the user. It also counts the number of
* terms in the sequence, and prints out that number.

* This solution is the same as the one in the book: Introduction to Programming Using Java, 
* by David J. Eck of Hobart and William Smith Colleges
* used as a coursework material by University of the People
* The only difference is that I replaced the TextIO class with Scanner class.
